She named me her own tree,
I was but a seedling.
My mother said,
"Guard your roots, baby." 

I reached down and
hugged the soil to me.
It's warmer in the earth mom
--Please don't move me.

I've tasted the sea-spray
And stale air in airplanes;
Touched velvet silt,
and palmed hard, red clay.

Chance kept me from
Staying in one place
Long enough for my green leaves
To grow stale and gray.

All I need,
As she sweeps up my roots into feet,
Is a moment to breathe.

No tree am I
But a tumbleweed for all I've seen,
And I never was green.
